## Explore your day

This is an example repository for assignment 3 submission.
(Put your a brief description of your final interactive visualization application and your dataset here.)


## Running Instructions

Access our visualization at [cse512-14w.github.io/a3-depstein-domoritz/](http://cse512-14w.github.io/a3-depstein-domoritz/) or download this repository and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000` and access this from http://localhost:9000/.


## Story Board

Put either your storyboard content or a [link to your storyboard pdf file](storyboard.pdf?raw=true) here.   Just like A2, you can use any software to create a *reasonable* pdf storyboard.


### Changes between Storyboard and the Final Implementation

A paragraph explaining changes between the storyboard and the final implementation.


## Development Process

* Daniel initially focused on the graph, Dominik focused on the map
* Daniel created a function to set the brush programatically, Dominik implemented the interaction between the map and the chart
* We spent about
  * 2 hours on the initial design of the story board
  * several hours on a failed attempt to use a D3 layer with leaflet (eventually we switched to pure Leaflet)
  * ? hours on the chart
  * 6 hours on the map
  * 8 hours on the interaction between the map and the chart and refinements
* Adding interaction between the map and the chart and within the chart and the map took the most time.
